                <h3>Moderator Applications</h3>
                We currently do not have moderator applications, because we do not need extra staff as of now.

                <h3>Ban Appeals</h3>
                We currently do not have a ban appeal system. If you are banned and wish to be unbanned, you can try messaging the owners, and remember to be nice and don't beg.
